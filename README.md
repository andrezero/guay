> Generate static sites from markdown

## WARNING: This code is not maintained

This project was an exploration at building a simple, fast, and modular, static site generator. 

At the time I was looking at tools that would help maintaining documentation and styleguides 
generated from markdown files and source code, and not so much [websites](https://andretorgal.com/tags/static-websites/).

For personal/commercial static websites, I recommending looking at the many awesome options in [Jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org/).

For styleguide drive development I recommend looking at [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

## Getting started

```
npm install guay
node ./node_modules/guay/cli.js develop --config guay.config.js --loglevel debug --watch
```
